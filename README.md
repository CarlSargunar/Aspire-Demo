# Aspire-Demo

This is the companion repo for my talk about .NET Aspire, which illustrates a mechanism to take a cloud-native application build with Docker Compose and move it to .NET Aspire. 

There are two applications in this repo - one build with Docker Compose, and one with Aspire. 

Slides for this talk are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pKHi34APKTjNJMnEQa6QBoe_FazFd_tjzxuLe4BMN38/)
